# Budget-Tracker

A simple website which tracks your incomes/expenses.

# Note:

Still under construction.

# Timeline

Around the 10th of April

In the first version when compared to the current version there was almost no styling, no way to know to know the total income or total expense, no way to know how much your profit or loss was and finally no database of any sort.

Around the 15th of April 2022

In the second version when compared to the current version there was a blue theme and the "total income", "total expense" and "profit or loss" features where implemented. An attempt to connect to the google sheets api was also made and there was still no database

Around the 11th of May 2022

There is a database working fine, a good green theme and the name was changed from Pound Tracker to Budget Tracker due to the public website not responding to changes made in the code which led to me deleting the database and a new project called Budget Tracker had to be created to fix that problem.

Around the 19th of May 2022

An attempt to use localStorage was made which failed. A great darkcyan theme has been implemented instead of the green theme.

Around the 4th of June 2022, I removed the total income, total expense and profit/loss features from the app due to a few errors in the web app, minor changes to the styling whre also made.

Thank you for reading!
