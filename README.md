# Budget-Tracker

A simple website which tracks your incomes/expenses.

# Note:

Still under construction.

# Timeline

Around the 10th of April

In the first version there was almost no styling, no way to know to know the total income or total expense, no way to know how much your profit or loss was and finally no database of any sort. It is also called Pound Tracker now.

Around the 15th of April 2022

In the second version there was a blue theme and the "total income", "total expense" and "profit or loss" features where implemented. An attempt to connect to the google sheets api was also made and there was still no database

Around the 11 of May 2022 | Now

There is a firestore database from firebase which works fine, a good green theme and the name was changed from Pound Tracker to Budget Tracker

Thank you for reading!
